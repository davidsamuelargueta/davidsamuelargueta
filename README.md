### Hi there, My name is David ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on small projects to learn Python with the use of libraries such as Pandas, matplot and numpy. But also making a simple plane game where you control a papaer plane and must fly through rings to add to your score. As of now I am looking to try and make the rings move in three dimensions. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analysis fundamentals to land a job as a data analyst. Furthermore I am also learning Unreal Engine 5 to create a game as a hobby as I am interested in learning new tech and to pursue a career in game devlopment in the future.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have an interest in Theoretical Mathematics, Quantum Physics and Video Games and wish to pursue a Master's in Mathematics or in Physics in the future
